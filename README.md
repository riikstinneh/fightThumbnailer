# Thumbnail tool for Artfight

A quite simple site made with React and deployed to Github Pages.
Made for personal need as a hobby project.

I am not associated with Artfight, I am merely an user of the site. (https://artfight.net/)

## FAQ
### Can you add the ability to choose the destination folder for the image?
No, as far as I know the browsers themselves do not allow this behaviour, as it might introduce security and privacy concerns.
